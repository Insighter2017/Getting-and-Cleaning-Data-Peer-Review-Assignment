Objective:  Collect, Manipulate, and Clean the Data Set

Files submitted with this project:
<OL>
<li>Cookbook: Cites data source and link to design of experiments.  Provides measurement units for hi-level activities</li>
<li>dataSet1_Mean_and_SD_Only.txt: Tidy data set with Mean and SD for each activity</li>
<li>dataSet2_averages.txt: Tidy data set with average for each activity</li>
<li>run_analysis.R: The annotated logic that produces both data sets</li>
</OL>

The project's objective is to provide two tidy data sets from the data sources provided by the instruction team.
* Blend the training and test data sets
* For each of the activities in the data set, pattern search the variables and remove the mean and sd suffixes
* Create one data set that calculates only the mean and standard deviation for each activity
* Create separate data set that calculates only the average for each activity.
* Use only one R script to generate both data sets.
